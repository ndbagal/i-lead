#WeekThree - Drive for Result Activity - Mandatory

As a part of the challenge phase, Drive for Result activity is a mandatory component for certification.

Please go through the video and answer the following questions in the comment section.

Q1. What is one of the most important goals that you want to set for yourself/your team?
One of the key goals discussed in the transcription is to make marginal improvements to routines or processes in order to achieve ambitious outcomes. The speaker emphasizes breaking down big goals into manageable tasks and making small adjustments that improve the odds of success.

Q2. Give an example of a decision that you must make to help you achieve the goal.
An example of a decision mentioned is when the speaker chose to break down tasks into small, manageable pieces. For instance, instead of trying to read multiple chapters of a book at once, the speaker decided to read just a few paragraphs at a time. This marginal adjustment allowed the speaker to focus for shorter periods and ultimately achieve better results in school and life.

Q3. Write down one thing that you will start doing, one thing you will stop doing, and one thing you will continue doing to build your team's drive for results.
Start: Begin focusing on marginal improvements and breaking larger goals into smaller, actionable tasks.
Stop: Stop being a spectator in decision-making processes, and avoid large, overwhelming goals that discourage progress.
Continue: Continue making small, consistent decisions that cumulatively increase the likelihood of achieving the desired outcomes, as seen with various personal achievements like learning a new language or completing challenging physical tasks.
